## Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - for new features
- `bugfix/description` - for bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - for urgent fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(tracking): add real-time location updates
fix(wallet): resolve MetaMask connection issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with descriptive commit messages

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Testing instructions
